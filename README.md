TODO: EDIT/COMPLETE explanation of work done for Iteration 1<br />
For this iteration, most of the groundwork for several user stories were implemented. Objects such as the Student, Course, Action, Time, and EnergyBar were implemented. Along with these new classes, we've completed first version of the temporary start screen as well as the course selection view. Logic was created to support the interactions between the objects.
In this iteration, the stub-database was setup to contain the information for object variables, student information and courses.
